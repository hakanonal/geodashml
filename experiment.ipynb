Th emain structure was the play function to advance the step, choosing the strategy (exploit or explore) and get the next action and update the q-value accoring to new step. Also agent class should initilize the network.\n",

I can not remember right now but onve I have read an article that someone has made a super mario agent with convolutional network ending up with multiple dense layer and giving the prediction of action to give. In our example the action set very very easy press space or not. dude this is so simple. So our state is going to be the numpy array from the screen shot we get earlier and the action is going to be single nouron. To construct the model I need to figure out the shapes of the input. So I will do that in aboove section. Well the shape is (600,785,4) it is 4 channel picture. Very high quality I do not think that we need that much hish quality picture but we will see. It is going to be wild advanture.\n",
    "- I am going to copy paste some code from my earlier learning sessions. My initial network will proablly overkill, but the idea is starting with convolutional layers following with pooling in the end flatten it with 2 dense layer and ending with single nuoron sigmoid layer. All middle dense layers are relu. This was genereally best pratice among the reading I have made so far. I may tweak the layer counts of conv and desse layers, nouron/filter sizes and shapes later. I think the padding should not be same because the input shape is already huge. It feels like it should be narrowed down quicklly.\n",

Well according to [this](https://pathmind.com/wiki/deep-reinforcement-learning) page since we have only one action we need one nouron.\n",

    "- Let's see...\n",
    "- Yes! well I did not understand why but the error gone. All I did was to restart the notebook.\n",
    "- Ok where were we?\n",
    "- Alright I have started the start method, start the game by pressing the space on html element. start a loop and succesfully read the score. The score is also being changed during the loop\n",
    "- So the score is being read too fast. see (0,0,1,2,3,4,5,5,6,7,7,8,8,9,9,10,11,11,12,12,12,13,13,14,14,15,15,15,15) same reward may be repeat itself. However when the game is over, I see that the same reward repeats itself much more then others. So let's 5 consecutive repeat of the same reward can be declared as 1 episode. However this may behave differently in different environments. This part is subject for an improvement. \n",
    "- On the other hand, In my experiement I have only printed the reward. I will now try to get the screen shot and maybe sent it to agent prediction so that one loop will be computationally more heavy. I wonder if I see not only repeating reward I may not see some of the rewards. Let's see...\n",
    "- Ok couple of wierd stuff is going on. First, I get the state with readState method and send it to agent's getQ method which should predict though network. I got a shape error. Because I see that when I do not hide the window then the resulation of the screen shot is changing and that's why the resulted numpy array has different shape. I need to transform the screen show every time :/, Other then that if I remove the getq from loop. I read wierd reward values when the window is hidden. I'll give one more try for that\n",
    "- Ok I got it now! To debug I print the element's text one before the reward. I was expecting to see \"Score\" text because the way of the html. After some loop I started to get not score but \"Player FPS\" text. That text was recognized before (check my notes before above). The problem with these htmls they are marked as same class names but they do not have unique id. I need to construct more clever css selectors.\n",
    "- I have read [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2717480/css-selector-for-first-element-with-class) article. I have some idea the different between firts-child and first-type-of. I will try one them by modifying the readScore method. It did not work. FPS value still appear after some time.\n",
    "- I need to see the full html when that FPS value appears. Since that FPS value appears only on hidden mode I need to code a test script. I did that by reading [this](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/get-html-source-of-web-element-in-selenium-webdriver)\n",

    "- The only attribute difference among the elements is the style that is repositionaning them. So maybe I can select via style attribute let give it try...\n",
    "- Yep It worked. However even the only selecting that element itself seems to be heavy computational thing. Even I did not get the q-vlue via network it skips some of the rewards. And adding the q-value makes it even worse. I can get only 2 reward values in each game. :/. I am pretty sure that reading the reward with this much expensive is going to be problem in the future. This will lower the frame rate a lot. We can not expect the agent react fast enough. I need to find a clever way to read or keep track of the reward."

Maybe sending the space key is since it is side key not a letter it should be used with keyup and keydown. by the way starting from begening of the game if I keep pressing the space bar I go way too much in the game. I will try to keep pressing key. After that I will try actions as mentioned in the [document](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/en/webdriver/keyboard/) \n",
